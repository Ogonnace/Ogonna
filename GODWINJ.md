## Journey Reflection

My experience with AltSchool's Frontend Track has been **bittersweet** but ultimately rewarding. While I encountered several challenges along the way, particularly in grasping certain React concepts, each obstacle became a learning opportunity that strengthened my understanding of frontend development.

### Challenges Faced

- **React State Management**: Initially struggled with understanding when and how to use state effectively
- **Component Lifecycle**: Grasping the timing of useEffect and dependency arrays
- **API Integration**: Handling asynchronous operations and error states
- **Responsive Design**: Creating layouts that work seamlessly across all devices

### What I'd Do Differently

- Spend more time on fundamental JavaScript concepts before diving into React
- Practice more small projects to reinforce learning
- Engage more actively with the community and peer learning sessions
- Document learning progress more consistently

## üîÑ Current Status & Next Steps

**Current Focus**: Consolidating React knowledge and building more complex applications

**Next Goals**:

- Exploring advanced React patterns and optimization techniques
- Learning state management libraries (Redux/Context API)
- Diving deeper into testing in React applications
- Exploring backend integration and full-stack development
